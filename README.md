## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** — v18 or higher → [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** — comes with Node.js (v9+)
- **Git** → [Download](https://git-scm.com/)

Check versions:
```bash
node -v   # should be v18+
npm -v    # should be v9+
```

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/humanforce.git
cd humanforce
```

Or if you already have the project folder:
```bash
cd path/to/meet_your_buddy
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all packages listed in `package.json`:
- `react` & `react-dom`
- `react-router-dom`
- `lucide-react`
- `vite` & `@vitejs/plugin-react` (dev)

---

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open automatically at:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```

> If port `5173` is in use, Vite will automatically pick the next available port (e.g., `5174`).

---

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output will be in the `/dist` folder — ready to deploy to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).

⚠️ You have been logged out due to 15 minutes of inactivy.                 we dosn't need to show this msg remove the msg.just log out and go to login page . 

i want all user and providers  record on the log history . 

On contact page i have fill the enquiry form but Where i can check it i mean thire is no recod on admin panel  show the enquery on admin panel.

As register any user or provider set a avtar on his profile .

next issue is When the user book a service on webpage then user is not register on our db so first redirect it to login or register page After register or login then its open the book a buddy page.

I think no need to a go to dashboard button button on registration and login page when its successfull login then direct login to dashboard for all Roles like admin or user and provider. 

When i request to book then the payment method is page is not loaded or take a too long time to open or :"Something went wrong error occured" after the error pop up is closed then the payment button was re set to re click.

Devlop the system to trace all the record all the  remaining payment of status is pending or clear means its compeleted. 
and also the booking is not accepting by the provider.

i think in super admin panel , the controll or action on record like user is active or in active edit the uesr and provider detail if neededt or delete the uer from record if needed so we want the options in user and provider panel on super adimin.


ON message trace system (hat Message Audit Logs) on super admin panel we short is as user based like a user will talk to a provider then the message panel show the uesr list with time stamp ,  and under the user it will open the page who show the provider list of the specific user who talk to providers, then we click on the provider name will show the conversation b/t user and provider. example  user bh-  talk to provider balram singh and raj singh , so first pamel show user based list then  we click on user name then open the list of user based provider , on provider click on provider name then open the conversation , b/t user and provider.


on the page of enquiries  weh have two action in progrss and resolve, i want the remark or not of the enquery or we have one more actaion call back late so when we click on call back later we also use the remark  what he say for it.

The Menu Log History must be show in Setting page as a button and we click the button then its open and also have a download Button of the log in excel.

I want a daily data  backup  at mid night and also remove the last backup when new backup was stored.
